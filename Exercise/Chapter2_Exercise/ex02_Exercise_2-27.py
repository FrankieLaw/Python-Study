    Question 2.27

    (Integer Equivalent of a Character) Here is a peek ahead. In this chapter you learned about
    integers and the type int. C++ can also represent uppercase letters, lowercase letters and a considerable
    variety of special symbols. C++ uses small integers internally to represent each different character.
    The set of characters a computer uses and the corresponding integer representations for those
    characters are called that computer's character set. You can print a character by enclosing that character
    in single quotes, as with
        
        cout << 'A'; // print an uppercase A

    You can print the integer equivalent of a character using static_cast as follows:
        
        cout << static_cast< int >( 'A' ); // print 'A' as an integer

    This is called a cast operation (we formally introduce casts in Chapter 4). When the preceding
    statement executes, it prints the value 65 (on systems that use the ASCII character set). Write a
    program that prints the integer equivalent of a character typed at the keyboard. Store the input in a
    variable of type char. Test your program several times using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits
    and special characters (like $).
